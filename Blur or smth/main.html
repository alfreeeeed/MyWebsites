	 					Box blur is a commonly used image filtering technique that is used to
						reduce image noise or to create a smoother appearance by averaging the
						pixel values within a given neighborhood. It is called a "box blur"
						 because it uses a square-shaped filter kernel to perform the blurring
						 operation.
 					</p>
 					<p>
	 					The algorithm starts by traversing each pixel of the image and
						creating a square neighborhood or kernel around it. The size of the
						kernel, often referred to as the blur radius, determines how many
						neighboring pixels are included in the averaging process.
 					</p>
 					<p>
	 					The algorithm calculates the average intensity value of all the
						pixels within the kernel and assigns this average value to the
						current pixel, effectively replacing its original intensity value.
						This process is repeated for all pixels in the image, gradually
						spreading out the pixel intensities and resulting in a blurred effect.
 					</p>
 					<p>
	 					Box blur can be applied to color images as well by performing
						the blur operation independently on each color channel (e.g., red, green,
						and blue) and recombining them to form the final blurred image.
 					</p>
 					<p>
	 					It's worth noting that box blur is a simple and fast blurring
						technique, but it may not produce the highest quality results compared
						to more advanced blurring algorithms such as Gaussian blur. However,
						it is widely used and often sufficient for various image processing tasks.

	 					Gaussian blur is a widely used image processing technique that helps
						 to reduce noise and smooth out images. It is named after the Gaussian
						  function, which is a mathematical function that describes a bell-shaped
							curve.
 					</p>
 					<p>
	 					The basic idea behind Gaussian blur is to average the pixel values
						of an image with the surrounding pixels, giving more weight to the
						pixels closer to the center and less weight to those farther away.
						This weighted averaging process results in a blurring effect that
						reduces the high-frequency details in the image.
 					</p>
 					<p>
	 					The blurring effect is determined by the size of the blur kernel,
						which is a matrix or a convolutional filter applied to the image.
						The size of the kernel determines the extent of the blurring effect.
						A larger kernel will produce a more pronounced blur, while a smaller
						kernel will result in a less noticeable blur.
 					</p>
 					<p>
	 					The weights assigned to the pixels in the kernel follow a Gaussian
						distribution, meaning that the central pixel has the highest weight,
						and the weights decrease symmetrically as you move away from the
						center. This weight distribution creates a smooth transition between
						pixels, resulting in a natural-looking blur.
 					</p>
 					<p>
	 					The Gaussian blur algorithm applies the kernel to each pixel in the
						image by convolving the kernel with the pixel values. The convolution
						process involves multiplying the corresponding kernel weights with
						the pixel values and summing them up. The resulting sum is then
						divided by the total weight of the kernel to obtain the final blurred
						pixel value.
 					</p>
 					<p>
	 					Gaussian blur is commonly used in various image processing
						applications, such as image smoothing, noise reduction, and creating
						special effects. It is especially useful for reducing the impact of
						random noise or imperfections in an image, resulting in a more
						visually pleasing and aesthetically appealing output.
